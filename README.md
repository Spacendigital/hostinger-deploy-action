# Hostinger Deploy Action

**Vercel-style deployment tracking for Hostinger.** Push to GitHub, get ✅/❌ on every commit with a live URL — no build logs, no config files, no complex CI pipelines.

Works with Hostinger Cloud Startup, Cloud, and Business plans that support Node.js hosting with Git auto-deploy. Uses SSH (password or key) — no API keys, no third-party services.

## Features

- **Zero configuration.** Auto-detects your site by scanning server directories and matching git remotes. No domain or path needed.
- **Commit status checks.** Every push creates a ✅ or ❌ on your commit with a link to the live site. Works in PRs too.
- **Deployments tab.** All deployments tracked in GitHub's Deployments API with environment URLs.
- **Doesn't touch your files.** The default mode (`ssh`) only reads — no `git pull`, no `npm install`, no build commands. Hostinger's built-in auto-deploy handles everything.
- **Optional build output.** Set `build-command: npm run build` to see real-time build logs in your action run.
- **SFTP fallback.** Supports file upload for shared hosting that doesn't have Git auto-deploy.

## Prerequisites

1. **Hostinger plan** with Node.js support (Cloud Startup, Cloud, or Business).
2. **Git auto-deploy** connected in hPanel for your site — Settings → Git → Connect your GitHub repository.
3. **SSH Access** enabled:
   - Go to **hPanel** → **Website Dashboard** → **Advanced** → **SSH Access**
   - Click **Enable**
   - Note your SSH credentials (host, username, password)
4. **GitHub repository secrets** with your SSH credentials.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add secrets to your GitHub repository

Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → add these:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `HOSTINGER_HOST` | Your server IP or hostname |
| `HOSTINGER_USERNAME` | Your SSH username |
| `HOSTINGER_PASSWORD` | Your SSH password |
| `HOSTINGER_PORT` | SSH port (usually `65002`) |

### 2. Create a workflow file

`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Hostinger

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  deployments: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: spacendigital/hostinger-deploy-action@v1
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_PASSWORD }}
          port: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_PORT }}
```

### 3. Push to `main` and see the result

Every push creates a deployment check on your commit — green checkmark ✅ with a link to your live site, or red cross ❌ if something went wrong.

## How Auto-Detection Works

The action connects via SSH and scans your server for the matching site:

1. **Scans** all directories under `~/domains/*/public_html/.builds/last-source/`
2. **Matches** each one against your current GitHub repository by checking `git remote get-url origin`
3. **Extracts** the domain from the matched path (e.g., `ghostwhite-tarsier-766023.hostingersite.com`)
4. **Verifies** the `nodejs/` directory exists for that domain
5. **Reports** success with `https://{domain}` as the live URL

This works with temporary Hostinger domains, custom domains, domain changes — anything. The git remote doesn't change, so the match always succeeds.

If auto-detection fails (e.g., Git auto-deploy is not connected), provide the `domain` or `target-dir` input explicitly.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `host` | ✅ | — | Server hostname or IP. Store as secret. |
| `username` | ✅ | — | SSH username. Store as secret. |
| `password` | — | — | SSH password. Store as secret. |
| `private-key` | — | — | SSH private key content (alternative to password). |
| `port` | — | `22` | SSH port. Store as secret. |
| `domain` | — | — | Your site domain (e.g., `kellshot.com`). Skips auto-detection. |
| `target-dir` | — | — | Full server path (e.g., `/home/user/domains/site.com/nodejs`). Alternative to `domain`. |
| `live-url` | — | — | Live site URL. Auto-detected from domain if omitted. |
| `deploy-mode` | — | `ssh` | `ssh` or `sftp`. |
| `build-command` | — | — | Build command (e.g., `npm run build`). Empty by default — Hostinger handles the build. |
| `install-command` | — | — | Install command (e.g., `npm ci`). Only used if `build-command` is set. |
| `environment` | — | `production` | GitHub deployment environment name. |
| `clean` | — | `false` | Delete remote files before upload (sftp only). |
| `source-dir` | — | `out` | Directory to upload (sftp only). |
| `token` | — | `${{ github.token }}` | GitHub token for deployment status. Usually not needed. |

## Advanced Usage

### Explicit domain (skip auto-detection)

```yaml
- uses: spacendigital/hostinger-deploy-action@v1
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_PASSWORD }}
    port: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_PORT }}
    domain: kellshot.com
```

### With build output (see logs in action run)

```yaml
- uses: spacendigital/hostinger-deploy-action@v1
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_PASSWORD }}
    port: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_PORT }}
    install-command: npm ci
    build-command: npm run build
```

### SFTP upload (shared hosting without Git auto-deploy)

```yaml
- uses: spacendigital/hostinger-deploy-action@v1
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.HOSTINGER_PASSWORD }}
    target-dir: /public_html
    deploy-mode: sftp
    build-command: npm run build
    install-command: npm ci
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Store everything in secrets.** Host, username, password, and port should all be GitHub repository secrets. Only the workflow file is public if your repo is public.
- **Use SSH keys instead of passwords** if possible. Provide the private key content via `private-key` input (store as secret).
- **Minimum permissions.** The workflow only needs `contents: read` and `deployments: write`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `No matching git repo found` | Git auto-deploy not connected in hPanel | Connect your repo in Hostinger → Settings → Git, or provide `domain` input |
| `Could not auto-detect project directory` | SSH works but no matching site found | Provide `domain` input (your site's domain) |
| SSH connection timeout | Port blocked or SSH not enabled | Enable SSH in hPanel → Advanced → SSH Access |
| `Permission denied` | Wrong credentials | Verify host, username, password in secrets |
| Node.js 20 deprecation warning | GitHub is phasing out Node 20 | Add `env: { FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true }` to your workflow |

## How It Works

```
Push to main
    │
    ▼
GitHub Actions triggers workflow
    │
    ▼
Action connects via SSH (password or key)
    │
    ├── Scans ~/domains/*/public_html/.builds/last-source/ for matching git remote
    │
    ├── Detects site domain and extracts live URL
    │
    ├── (Optional) Runs install + build commands on the server
    │
    └── Creates ✅/❌ on commit with live URL via GitHub Deployments API
```

No API tokens, no SSH config files, no hardcoded paths. The action reads your server state — it doesn't write.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
